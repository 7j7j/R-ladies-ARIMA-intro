# Required packages
<b>forecast</b>: we will use the <b>forecast::arima</b> wrapper and related functions in this package, which enhance the <b>base::arima</b> function included in the default R stats package <br>
<b>tidyverse</b>: recommended, not strictly necessary for practical exercises, though my data tidying and visualisation use dplyr, ggplot2, etc

# Directory
1) Case DATA in <b>"ARIMA-intro.csv"</b> <br>
2) Case CODE in <b>"ARIMA-intro.R"</b> <br>
3) Contextual and theoretical SLIDES, including important fundamentals of underlying statistical theory, in <b>"ARIMA-slides.html"</b> including a list of references and further useful reading <br>
4) Original inspiration for this practical case comes from Mark Green et al's article "Could the rise in mortality rates since 2015 be explained by changes in the number of delayed discharges of NHS patients?" <br>
in the BMJ Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health at https://jech.bmj.com/content/71/11/1068 <br>
... with many thanks to Mark at the University of Sheffield (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Green10), and co-authors Danny Dorling, Jonathan Minton, and Kate E Pickett for the applied case in English health equity that surfaces such important and interesting policy questions <br>
